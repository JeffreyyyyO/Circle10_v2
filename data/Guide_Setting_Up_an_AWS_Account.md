# **Setting Up an AWS Account**

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up an AWS account and accessing cloud services using the free tier:

1. Go to the AWS website: Navigate to the [**AWS website**](https://aws.amazon.com/) in your web browser.  
2. **Click on "Create an AWS Account":** This button is usually located at the top right corner of the page.  
3. **Enter your email address and account name:** Fill in your email address and choose a unique name for your AWS account.  
4. **Verify your email address:** AWS will send a verification code to your email address. Enter the code on the AWS page.  
5. **Create a strong password:** Choose a password that's at least 8 characters long and includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
6. **Provide contact information:** Enter your name, address, and phone number. You'll receive a phone call or SMS from AWS to verify your account.  
7. **Enter payment information:** Although you're signing up for the free tier, AWS requires a credit card or other payment method for identity verification. You won't be charged for services within the free tier limits.  
8. **Choose a support plan:** Select the Basic plan, which is free.  
9. **Sign in as root user:** Once your account is set up, you can sign in as the root user using your email address and password.  
10. **Set up IAM user (optional but recommended):** For security, create an IAM user with administrator privileges to perform daily tasks instead of using the root user.  
11. **Explore AWS services:** You're now ready to start using AWS services within the free tier limits. Some popular services include:  
    * Amazon S3 (storage)  
    * Amazon EC2 (virtual servers)  
    * Amazon RDS (relational databases)  
    * Amazon Lambda (serverless computing)  
12. **Monitor your usage:** Keep an eye on your usage to avoid exceeding free tier limits and incurring charges.

That's it\! You're now set up to start using AWS services within the free tier.
