# **Endpoints**

## **Introduction to Endpoints**

* An endpoint can be considered as a device that enables an employee to connect to a corporate network. The growth in BYOD and other connected systems such as the Internet of Things (IOT) is seeing the number of devices that could potentially connect to a network increase exponentially.

* Endpoints now extend beyond the laptops and mobile phones that employees use to get their work done. They encompass any machine or connected device that could concæivably connect to a corporate network. And these endpoints are particularly lucrative entry points to business networks and systems for hackers. It is therefore vital for organizations to consider every device that is or could be connected to their network and ensure it is protected. Furthermore, as the endpoints evolve and increase in sophistication, so too do the security solutions that protect them from being exploited.

## **Examples of Endpoints**

Some of the more common devices that can be considered endpoints include:

* ATM machines  
* IoT-enabled smart devices  
* Industrial machines  
* Laptop computers  
* Medical devices  
* Mobile phones  
* Printers  
* Servers  
* Tablets  
* Wearables, such as smartwatches

# **Endpoint Security**

## **Introduction to Endpoint Security**

* Every endpoint that connects to the corporate network is a vulnerability, providing a potential entry point for cyber criminals. Therefore, every device an employee uses to connect to any business system or resource carries the risk of becoming the chosen route for hacking into an organization. These devices can be exploited by malware that could leak or steal sensitive data from the business.

* In the face of this, it is imperative for businesses to deploy solutions that can analyze, detect, then and contain cyber attacks as they happen. Organizations also need to collaborate with one another and utilize technologies that provide their IT and security teams with visibility into advanced threats, enabling them to quickly detect security risks for swift remediation of potential issues.

* The modern business landscape is seeing an increasing volume of cybersecurity threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. Hackers launch a cyberattack **every 39 seconds,** with a daily total of 2,244 attacks.

* Endpoints are one of the most common targets, given the sheer number of them in use to connect to networks. According to **Strategy Analytics Insight** there were already 22 billion connected devices in 2018, which is predicted to rise to 38.6 billion devices by 2025 and 50 billion devices by 2030\. As a result, **Verizon's threat report** found that up to 30% of **data breaches** involved **malware** being installed on endpoints.

## **Endpoint Security**

Endpoint security is the process of protecting devices like workstations, servers, and other devices (that can accept a security client) from malicious threats and cyberattacks. **Endpoint security software** enables businesses to protect devices that employees use for work purposes or servers that are either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.

## **Importance of Endpoint Security**

Every device that employees use to connect to business networks represents a potential risk that cyber criminals can exploit to steal corporate data. These devices, or endpoints, are proliferating and making the task of securing them more difficult. It is therefore vital for businesses to deploy tools and solutions that protect their cybersecurity front line.

## **Goals of Endpoint Security**

* The main goal of any endpoint security solution is to protect data and workflows associated with all devices that connect to the corporate network. It does this by examining files as they enter the network and comparing them against an ever-increasing database of threat information, which is stored in the cloud.

* The endpoint security solution provides system admins with a centralized management console that is installed on a network or server and enables them to control the security of all devices connecting to them. Client software is then deployed to each endpoint, either remotely or directly. With the endpoint set up, the software pushes updates to it whenever necessary, authenticates login attempts that are made from it, and administers corporate policies.

* The endpoint security solution secures endpoints through application control. This blocks the user from downloading or accessing applications that are unsafe or unauthorized by the organization. It also uses encryption to prevent data loss.

* The endpoint security solution enables businesses to quickly detect malware and other common security threats. It can also provide endpoint monitoring, detection and response, which enables the business to detect more advanced threats like fileless malware, polymorphic attacks, and zero-day attacks. This more advanced approach providæ enhanced visibility and a wider variety of options in the face of a security threat.

# **Endpoint Security Vs Antivirus Or Antimalware**

## **Antivirus**

* Antivirus software helps businesses detect, eliminate, and prevent malware from infecting devices. Antivirus solutions are installed directly on endpoint devices, such as laptops, PCs, network servers, and mobile devices. These solutions detect malware by scanning files and directories to discover patterns that match the definitions and signatures of a virus. They can also only recognize known threats and must be updated to detect the latest malware strains.

## **Endpoint Security**

* Endpoint security threat prevention is fundamentally different from the approach of antivirus software. Instead of protecting an individual device, endpoint security solutions protect the entire business network, including all of the endpoints connecting to it.

## **Comparison: Endpoint Security VS Antivirus**

* **Device coverage:** Traditional antivirus programs are designed to protect one single device, such as the antivirus programs placed onto laptops to keep them secure. Endpoint security solutions, on the other hand, look to protect all of the connected devices across an entire enterprise network.

* **Protection from threats:** Antivirus solutions protect businesses from malware that is included within the businesses' database of known threats. But sophisticated threats typically do not feature a traditional signature, which could leave businesses vulnerable. Endpoint security solutions take a more holistic view that protects businesses from threats such as data loss, fileless and signatureless malware, and phishing attacks in addition to known risks.

* **Continuous protection:** Antivirus solutions use a signature-based detection process to discover and protect businesses from potential risks. This means if a user has not updated their antivirus program, then they could still be at risk. In contrast, endpoint security solutions connect to the cloud and update automatically, ensuring users always have the latest version available.

* **Advanced internal protection:** Traditional antivirus programs can block malware, but they do not prevent employees from putting sensitive data on a USB drive and stealing it from the organization. Endpoint solutions offer greater protection from threats like data loss and **data leakage** through technologies like data encryption and data access controls. This ensures unauthorized employees cannot get hold of data beyond their access rights and steal or sell it. Endpoint security also utilizes advanced technologies such as behavioral analysis that enable businesses to detect threats based on suspicious behavior from external and internal sources.

* **Admin control:** Antivirus solutions relied on users manually updating the software in order to keep it in line with new malware risks. But endpoint solutions provide interconnected security that moves the admin responsibility to the IT or security team. This removes the risk of human error putting end-users' devices at risk.

* **Integration:** An antivirus solution operates as a single program that performs a specific function. But an endpoint security approach offers the important advantage of integration, whereby various solutions are included within a suite that can be easily integrated for more comprehensive security protection.

* **Enterprise-wide control:** Traditional antivirus solutions typically only notify a user when a threat is detected. The risk will then need to be analyzed and investigated in person by a security professional. But endpoint security solutions provide a centralized portal that enables admins to monitor activity, install, configure, patch, and update software, investigate any suspicious traffic, and resolve issues remotely. It also enables admins to carry out these actions to multiple endpoints at the same time, which speeds up issue resolution for employees and saves IT and security teams huge amounts of time.

# **Non-Compliance With Endpoint Security**

## **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

Non-compliance with endpoint security can lead to severe consequences, including significant financial penalties, legal actions, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. These can range from fines for regulatory breaches to the loss of customer trust and even business closure

### **Financial Penalties and Legal Actions:**

* **Fines and Penalties:** Regulatory bodies can impose substantial fines for non-compliance with cybersecurity standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA, which can be a percentage of global revenue.  
* **Lawsuits:** Affected parties, including customers, clients, or other businesses, may pursue legal action to recover damages from data breaches or other security incidents.  
* **Loss of Payment Processing Privileges:** Non-compliant businesses may lose the ability to accept card payments.

### **Reputational Damage:**

* **Loss of Customer Trust:** Data breaches and security incidents can severely damage a company's reputation, leading to loss of customer confidence and business.  
* **Difficulty Regaining Trust:** Rebuilding trust after a breach can be a long and challenging process, potentially impacting future business opportunities.

* **Increased Security Costs:** Responding to and recovering from a breach can significantly increase security costs.

# **Common Threats Facing Endpoints**

## **Threats of Endpoints**

Endpoint security risks refer to the vulnerabilities and potential threats that target devices, or endpoints, connected to a network. Endpoints include any device that communicates with a network, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, desktops, and servers. Because these devices often serve as entry points into a network, they are prime targets for cybercriminals.

## **How They Work**

* **Targeting Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in endpoint devices, such as outdated software, weak passwords, or misconfigured settings. These vulnerabilities can provide a pathway for unauthorized access or malware infections.  
* **Gaining Access:** Once a vulnerability is exploited, attackers can gain access to the endpoint and, by extension, the network it connects to. This access can allow attackers to steal data, install malware, or gain control over the device.  
* **Spreading Laterally:** After compromising one endpoint, attackers often use it as a launching pad to move laterally across the network, targeting other connected devices. This spread can quickly escalate, leading to widespread network compromise.  
* **Executing Threats:** With control over an endpoint, attackers can execute various types of cyberattacks, such as ransomware, data exfiltration, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, causing significant disruption to the organ.

## **Types of Endpoint Threats** 

### **Phishing**

* A typical phishing email. Such messages can be characterized by a suspicious sender, grammatical errors, and a malicious link.  
* The most popular and least sophisticated form of cyber threats, phishing, is the use of fake messages to gain access. The message ostensibly comes from a trustworthy entity (such as a bank or known company) to trick users into providing personal information or downloading malware. The information or malware is then used to gain access to the user's system, and from there gain a foothold into the larger network that the user works for.  
* There have been massive phishing attacks throughout history, here are some examples:  
  * Phishing is responsible for the JPMorgan Chase breach that compromised 76 million households and 7 million businesses;  
  * 2014 Sony Pictures hack that saw private emails leaked, movies released to torrent sites, and cost the company over $100 million.

### **Outdated Patches**

* One of the pains of modern life, constant patches for operating systems are a slight inconvenience but a necessary evil to keep up with evolving threats online. And yet many companies (even those on the Forbes 500\) still neglect to hit the update button.  
* The most famous example is Equifax's data breach in 2017\. The credit reporting agency failed to patch a glaring vulnerability in one of its servers, which allowed hackers to steal the personal data of 148 million US consumers. The ensuing debacle ended in a $650 million FTC fine and a $77.5 million class-action settlement.

### **Malware Ads**

* Also known as malvertising, this scam uses legitimate-looking advertisements, and can propagate across reputable websites and social media before being taken down.  
* In recent years, sophisticated malware have appeared that don't require any user interaction at all. Such "pre-click" malware can be embedded in the main scripts of webpages, enabling them to run automatically even without being clicked by the user. Host victims include popular sites like The New York Times, the London Stock Exchange, and Spotify.

### **Data Loss and Theft**

* Data loss refers to sensitive data being irretrievably deleted. For an individual, this endpoint security risk can be devastating \- years' worth of personal photos, portfolio or correspondence. For an organization, this can be fatal: according to a University of Texas study, 94% of businesses that experience extensive data loss go belly up \- 43% shut down immediately, while 51% close up within two years.  
* Data theft is even more insidious. This means that priceless corporate data, from customer databases to years of R\&D, can end up on the dark web or in the hands of competitors.  
* The 2023 IBM Cost of Data Breach Study revealed that the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million, marking a 15% increase over three years. This trend has particularly impacted the healthcare, financial, and pharmaceutical sectors.

### **Ransomware**

* Ransomware attacks continue to wreak havoc across industries, with education, finance, and healthcare among the most targeted. In 2024, the average ransom demand surged to $2.73 million, reflecting a dangerous upward trend. Education remains particularly vulnerable, with 79% of institutions hit by attacks. Meanwhile, finance and insurance sectors experienced a 64% increase in incidents, making them prime targets.  
* No organization is immune, and as ransomware attacks grow more sophisticated, businesses must prioritize cybersecurity to avoid crippling losses.

### **Advanced Persistent Threats**

APTs refer to groups that gain access to a network and remain undetected for a long period. As the name implies, they are distinct from typical hacker groups in three ways:

* **Advanced:** They have access to a wide range of both commercial and non-commercial intrusion technologies, including advanced hardware and software available only to nation-state actors  
* **Persistent:** Rather than being short-term opportunists, APTs are content to lie dormant in compromised networks for months or years, similar to "sleeper cells"  
* **Organized:** Compared to informal groups, APTs are highly organized, disciplined and coordinated in their intrusion and execution

### **Botnet Attacks**

* A botnet is any device that has been compromised and can be controlled by unauthorized people. They can be used to send spam, infect other devices, or carry out DDoS attacks as part of a botnet campaign. In effect, the device has become part of a "zombie army" without the owner being aware of it.  
* In the past botnets were limited to PCs. Today, thanks to the prevalence of IoT (Internet of Things), a wider range of wireless devices are vulnerable to botnet infection. These range from Android smartphones and tablets to smart TVs, CCTV cameras and even smart home appliances like Alexa-enabled lights and microwave ovens.  
* This endpoint security risk is a double pain because once infected, a portion of the device's processing power, energy and bandwidth goes to botnet attacks whenever it gets activated to take part in a botnet campaign.
