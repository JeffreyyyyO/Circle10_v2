# Data Privacy & Professional Issues

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

* Explain **data privacy vs data security** using real-world analogies  
* Recognize **ethical red flags** before they become incidents  
* Connect **key global privacy laws** to real cybersecurity failures  
* Apply **professional codes of ethics** under business pressure  
* Make defensible decisions using **Privacy by Design** principles  
* Understand how **historical privacy failures** shaped today’s regulations

# Introduction: Privacy vs Security — The Core Distinction 

### **Privacy and Security Are Siblings, Not Twins**

In cybersecurity, privacy and security are often used interchangeably—but confusing them leads to serious professional mistakes.

* **Security** answers:  
  *“How do we protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss?”*  
* **Privacy** answers:  
  *“Should we be collecting this data at all—and if yes, how fairly and transparently?”*

## Analogy: The Bank Vault vs the Customer Agreement

* A **bank vault** with biometric locks, guards, and cameras represents **security**.  
* The **terms that explain what the bank is allowed to do with your money** represent **privacy**.

A bank can secure your money perfectly—and still violate your rights by freezing accounts unfairly or selling transaction data.

🔑 **Key Insight:** A secure system can still be unethical.

## Key Event: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica (2018)

* Facebook’s infrastructure was technically secure  
* Users *consented*—but without understanding  
* Data was repurposed for political manipulation

**Lesson:** Security without meaningful privacy controls is a liability.

# Ethical Challenges in Modern Cybersecurity

Ethical issues in cybersecurity rarely announce themselves loudly. They arrive disguised as:

* Business goals  
* Deadlines  
* “Temporary” shortcuts

## Ethical Challenge 1: Algorithmic Bias

#### **Analogy: A Biased Speed Camera**

Imagine a speed camera calibrated to trigger more often for certain car models.

In cybersecurity and data systems:

* Historical data encodes bias  
* AI systems amplify it at scale

#### **Key Event: COMPAS Risk Assessment Tool (US Justice System)**

* Used to predict criminal reoffending  
* Disproportionately flagged minorities as high-risk

**Ethical Question:** Who is accountable—the algorithm or the professional who deployed it?

## Ethical Challenge 2: Surveillance Capitalism

#### **Analogy: The Free Supermarket**

Imagine a supermarket where:

* Everything is free  
* Every movement, glance, and hesitation is tracked  
* That behavior is sold to insurers and advertisers

You didn’t pay with money—you paid with **intimate behavioral data**.

#### **Key Event: Google Location Tracking Revelations**

* Users disabled location tracking  
* Data collection continued via alternate signals

**Ethical Tension:** Innovation vs informed consent

## Ethical Challenge 3: Dark Patterns

#### **Analogy: The One-Way Door**

A building with:

* Clear entrance signs  
* Hidden exits

This mirrors apps where:

* “Accept All” is obvious  
* Opt-out is buried

#### **Key Event: GDPR Fines Against Meta (EU)**

* Consent obtained through interface manipulation  
* Record-breaking fines imposed

**Key Rule:** Consent obtained through deception is invalid.

# Global Privacy Laws — Why They Exist 

Privacy laws were not written in theory—they were written in response to harm.

## 🇪🇺 GDPR (European Union)

### Analogy: Building Codes for Data

Just as buildings must meet safety codes:

* Systems must embed privacy **by design**  
* Not bolted on after deployment

### Trigger Events:

* Mass data breaches  
* Unchecked corporate surveillance

### Key Principles:

* Lawful processing  
* Data minimization  
* Right to be forgotten

## 🇺🇸 CCPA / CPRA (California)

### Analogy: Ingredient Labels for Data

Consumers have the right to:

* Know what’s inside  
* Refuse certain ingredients

### Key Trigger:

* Data broker abuse  
* Opaque data markets

## APEC Privacy Framework

### Analogy: International Traffic Rules

Different countries, shared roads.

The framework balances:

* Cross-border data flow  
* National protections

## Reality Check

If your system touches the internet, **you are operating globally by default**.

# Professional Ethics — Your Last Line of Defense 

## Analogy: The Compass, Not the Map

* Laws are the **map** (specific, slow to update)  
* Ethics are the **compass** (guides you in uncertainty)

## Core Codes

### (ISC)²

* Protect society and the common good

### ISACA

* Act with due care

### ACM

* Avoid harm  
* Respect privacy

### Key Event: Uber Data Breach Cover-Up (2016)

* Breach concealed  
* Executives charged

### Lesson:

Following orders does not equal ethical compliance.

# Privacy by Design — Engineering Ethics into Systems (20 minutes)

## Analogy: Seatbelts in Cars

We don’t ask drivers to install seatbelts themselves.

Privacy should be:

* Built-in  
* Automatic  
* Non-optional

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy as Default**  
   Opt-out should not be harder than opt-in.  
2. **Data Minimization**  
   Every data field must justify its existence.  
3. **End-to-End Protection**  
   From collection to secure deletion.

## Real Practices

* Tokenization  
* Short retention policies  
* Zero-trust access

# Tabletop Exercise: The Vulnerable Whistleblower 

## Scenario

You are the **Lead Security Auditor** at **HealthTrack**, a fitness-tech company.

You discover:

* Hard-coded access paths  
* Unencrypted biometric & GPS data  
* Third-party misuse

### **Complication**

The CEO requests a **90-day delay** to protect an IPO.

Meanwhile, insurers exploit the data.

### **Group Tasks**

1. Identify ethical violations  
2. Map legal exposure  
3. Decide on escalation paths  
4. Design a Privacy by Design fix

### **Historical Parallel: Theranos Whistleblower Case**

* Pressure to stay silent  
* Severe public harm

# Career Takeaways — The Long Game 

## The Front-Page Test

If this decision became public, would you defend it?

## Final Insight

Technical skill makes you employable.

## Ethical judgment makes you trustworthy.

# Student Reflection & Self-Check

1. Describe privacy vs security using an analogy.  
2. Name one ethical failure that led to regulation.  
3. Explain why Privacy by Design matters.
